### RAM Defaults

- In order to have a smooth performance the RAM allocation to JVM is set to 4GB in default.
If you want to start MSC with a different RAM specification, you have to edit one of the 
existing "MSC_<OS>" file.
- In the third row, modify option "-Xmx?g" where ? specifies the amount of RAM you want to allocate for the JVM in gigabytes.

- A short and comprehensive introduction to MSC is provided in the "Tutorial" folder.
