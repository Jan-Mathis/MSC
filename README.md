# Molecule Set Comparator (MSC)
The open rich-client Molecule Set Comparator (MSC) application enables a versatile and fast comparison of large molecule sets with a unique inter-set molecule-to-molecule mapping obtained e.g. by machine learning approaches. The molecule-to-molecule comparison is based on chemical descriptors obtained with the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK), such as Tanimoto similarities, atom/bond/ring counts or physicochemical properties like logP. The results are presented graphically and summarized by interactive histograms that can be exported in publication quality.

MSC is currently under scientific review - more information will be available soon.

## Running MSC

- A precompiled [jar file](https://github.com/Kohulan/MSC/tree/master/installation/MSC_1.0/lib) already provided in this repository in order to directly use it, please have a look at the [steps](https://github.com/Kohulan/MSC/blob/master/installation/MSC_1.0/README.MD) provided under the installation directory.

## Notes
- MSC is not modularized due to its non-modularized library dependencies.
